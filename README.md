# PCA vs AutoEncoder
This paper presents the implementation and Analysis of two different techniques of dimensionality reduction 
for a given dataset. One being linear(PCA) and other being non-linear(Autoencoder). The analysis involves the 
implementation of an autoencoder and PCA for reconstructing the dataset using the MINST dataset and
the Wine dataset.
